- random maze or obsticles
- figure out collision player

- monster can go through walls? pro: no path finding nessecary

- light is dimmer and darker when further from the player
--> idea layer of cicular gradient around player at all times


- idea: mouse position relativ to player
--> if further from player: light cone wider, but light dimmer and shorter
--> if closer to player: light cone more narrow, but brighter and longer
