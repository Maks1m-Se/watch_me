- random maze or obsticles DONE
- figure out collision player DONE

- monster can go through walls? pro: no path finding nessecary DONE

- light is dimmer and darker when further from the player DONE
--> idea layer of cicular gradient around player at all times


- idea: mouse position relativ to player
--> if further from player: light cone wider, but light dimmer and shorter
--> if closer to player: light cone more narrow, but brighter and longer


next step:
- player has to stay alive for a certain amount of time to win (depending on difficulty)
- player starts in a random corner, monster spawns somewhere random, but in opposite side
maybe in one of the other free corners
